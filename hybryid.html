	 <h1>Mercedes hybrid performance</h1>
	 
	 <p>This derivative of the C-class is a response to the growing trend of electrification,
	 which is driven largely by the prodding provided by tightening fuel-economy and emissions standards.</p>
	 
	 <p>The hybrid C-class is based on the Europe-only C250, which is powered by a 208-hp version of the same 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 241 horses in the U.S.-market C300.
	 Combined with an 80-hp electric motor, the powertrain is good for 275 horsepower and maximum torque of 443 lb-ft.
	 Zero to 60 mph comes in 5.9 seconds, according to Mercedes, and top speed is governed at 130 mph. But these are the stats that matter more: This hybrid can reach 80 mph on electric power alone,
	 and it can travel 20 emissions-free miles on a charge (although likely not at 80 mph).</p>
	 
	 <p>In addition to the expected Economy, Comfort, Sport, Sport Plus, and Individual modes for the seven-speed automatic transmission,
	 there are four operating modes for the powertrain: electric only (dubbed E-mode), hybrid (um, Hybrid),
	 a mode that maintains the present level of battery charge and therefore limits electric driving (E-save), 
	 and another that uses the engine to recharge the battery (Charge).
	 The last two are not very efficient, but they can spare the driver the trouble of plugging the car into an electrical outlet at the end of the trip.</p>
	 
	 <p>The electric energy is stored in a high-voltage, liquid-cooled, lithium-ion battery. Packaging this 220-pound unit diminishes trunk space by less than 10 percent.
	 Is it worth it? If your driving involves a lot of short distances, and if you’re good about plugging in, you will be able to sharply increase your mileage and lower your fuel costs,
	 although you likely won’t get anywhere near the 112 mpg Mercedes claims for the car using the ridiculous European testing standards for plug-in hybrids.</p>
	 
	 <p>Offered in base and Luxury trim levels with rear-wheel drive only, the plug-in C350 will be positioned between the C300 and the C400 in the C-class lineup.
	 It will be sold only in the California-emissions states, beginning this autumn.</p>
